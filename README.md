# SE-475 Homework 5

## Preface
- This project uses SQLite as its database
 - If you do not have a way to browse SQLite .db files, here are some options:
 1. [SQLite Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
 2. [SQLite Online](https://sqliteonline.com/)
 - The second option will require re-uploading the Books.db file every time it is updated by the java application, so I would recommend SQLite Browser
## Instructions
1. Click the green "Clone or Download" link and download the .zip file
2. Unzip the file to find the full Netbeans project
3. Grade accordingly
